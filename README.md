## Features

**Huge database**: The API collects most of known movies (6000+) and shows (3000+)

**Performance**: A strong effort has been made to get the best performance from UI navigation and downloading

**Capabilities**: Popcorn offers a wide set of functionalities (Trailer, subtitles, Chromecast support, filtering by genre and rating, ...)

## How does it work

### Frontend
#### Framework
The app is a .NET 4.6.2 application using WPF framework. 

#### Basics
It communicates with its own [API](https://github.com/bbougot/PopcornAPI) to query movies, shows, trailers, cast, assets and torrents.
The app includes a video player ([ffmediaelement](https://github.com/unosquare/ffmediaelement)) and a torrent handler ([libtorrent](https://github.com/bbougot/libtorrent-net)). It is also able to cast to a Chromecast device.

#### Advanced
The app can update by itself automatically using an incremental update system.

Popcorn also sends usage data to Azure Application Insights.

### Backend
The [API](https://github.com/bbougot/PopcornAPI) is a ASP.NET Core app which serves movies and shows from SQL Server database.
It also supports caching using Redis database.

The assets (images and torrent files) are stored on Azure Blob Storage.

## Supported platforms
Windows 7+ is supported (Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10).
